<p>In a closed system, any reversible reaction will eventually reach a point where the amounts of reactants and products do not change. This occurs when the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction. At this point, the system is said to be in equilibrium&mdash;the reactions are occurring but no observable changes can be measured. This does not mean the concentrations of reactants and products are equal. The forward and reverse reactions create an equal balance of opposing rates.</font></p>

<p>These ideas can be expressed mathematically in the form of the equilibrium constant. Consider the following general equation for a reversible chemical reaction:</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:5%"><b>Equation 1: </b></font>aA + bB &rarr; cC + dD </font></p>

<p>The equilibrium constant, K</font><sub>eq</font></sub>, for this general reaction is given by Equation 2, where the square brackets refer to the molar concentrations of the reactants and products at equilibrium.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:5%"><b>Equation 2:&nbsp;<img alt="" src="/Content/Images/FRQImages/56478_132112911724223093_Eq.2_14_03.PNG" style="width: 112px; height: 56px;" /></b></font></p>

<p>The equilibrium constant gets its name from the fact that for any reversible chemical reaction, the value of K</font><sub>eq</font></sub> is a constant at a particular temperature. The concentrations of reactants and products at equilibrium vary, depending on the initial amounts of materials present. The special ratio of reactants and products described by K</font><sub>eq</font></sub> is always the same, as long as the system has reached equilibrium and the temperature does not change.</font></p>

<p>Any change that is made to a system at equilibrium may be considered a stress&mdash;this includes adding or removing reagents, or changing the temperature or pressure. The rates of the forward and reverse reactions will change as a result until equilibrium is again established. Henry Le Chatelier published many studies of equilibrium systems. Le Chatelier&rsquo;s principle predicts how equilibrium can be restored:</font></p>

<p>&ldquo;If an equilibrium system is subjected to a stress, the system will react in such a way as to reduce the stress.&rdquo;</font></p>

<p>The effect of concentration on a system at equilibrium depends on whether the change in concentration is affecting a reactant or product species. In general, when the concentration of a species is increased, the system will shift and increase the rate of the reaction that decreases the concentration of that species. If the concentration of a species is decreased, the system will shift and increase the rate of the reaction that increases the concentration of the species. For example, if the concentration of a reactant is increased, the rate of the forward reaction will increase because the forward reaction decreases the concentration of reactants.</font></p>

<p>The equilibrium constant for a reaction depends on changes with temperature. The observable effect of temperature on a system at equilibrium depends on whether the reaction is endothermic (absorbs heat) or exothermic (produces heat). If a reaction is endothermic, heat appears on the reactant side in the chemical equation. Increasing the temperature of an endothermic reaction shifts the equilibrium in the forward direction, absorbing some of the excess energy and making more products. The opposite effect is observed for exothermic reactions. In the case of an exothermic reaction, heat appears on the product side in the chemical equation. Increasing the temperature of an exothermic reaction shifts the equilibrium in the reverse direction.</font></p>

<p>The effect of pressure on a gaseous system at equilibrium depends on the partial pressures of the gases and the stoichiometry of the reaction. A change in pressure of a gaseous system has the effect of altering the partial pressures of the gases, and is typically accomplished through changes in volume. An increase in volume results in an overall decrease in pressure. The system will respond in a way as to produce more gas molecules to fill the space. Thus, the reaction will shift towards the side with the greater number of moles of gas. If the volume of the container is decreased, the overall pressure will increase and the system will shift in the direction of the side with fewer number of moles of gas in order to decrease the pressure.</font></p>
